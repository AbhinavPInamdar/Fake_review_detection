# Fake_review_detection
##*Problem statement*
The exponential growth of e-commerce and online services has made user-generated reviews a critical factor in consumer decision-making. However, fake or deceptive reviews—intentionally crafted to mislead—are becoming increasingly prevalent. These fraudulent reviews can:

*Distort the perceived reputation of businesses, products, or services.
*Lead to unfair consumer decisions and financial repercussions.
*Damage the credibility of review platforms.
Manual identification of fake reviews is impractical at scale due to the sheer volume of data, necessitating the use of automated methods.
