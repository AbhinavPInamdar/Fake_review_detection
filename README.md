# Fake Review Detection

## **Problem Statement**
The exponential growth of e-commerce and online services has made user-generated reviews a critical factor in consumer decision-making. However, fake or deceptive reviews—intentionally crafted to mislead—are becoming increasingly prevalent. These fraudulent reviews can:

- Distort the perceived reputation of businesses, products, or services.
- Lead to unfair consumer decisions and financial repercussions.
-Damage the credibility of review platforms.
Manual identification of fake reviews is impractical at scale due to the sheer volume of data, necessitating the use of automated methods.

## **Features**
- List the key features of your project.
- For example:
  - Automatically detects fake reviews using machine learning.
  - Analyzes text-based, behavioral, and metadata features.
  - Provides metrics for evaluating review authenticity.

## **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python (e.g., version 3.12)
- Libraries and Frameworks:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - LSTM
  - TensorFlow.keras
  - seaborn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git
